Devilry compelled The Mist.

Every place.  Every shadow.  The thick haze, like a grey-green soup, lingered in the valleys and hollows.

Then why not just take the high roads, Bayle? my lesser-witted-self asked.  Because my destination was my ship, which lay berthed within the Sovereign City of Sarburh.   And that  is about as low as you can get and not get wet.  

Plus The Mist was rising.  It had begun like a puddle, barely high enough to reach the laces of my boots, but over the last hours it had surged until it was perhaps as deep as my waist.  Not that I was foolish enough to wade in to test it.

The Mist had an iniquitous quality about it, and I had the distinct feeling that whoever, or whatever, had conjured it, had done so purposely.  For me. Whether to merely hinder, or to eliminate, I hadnâ€™t yet determined.  Or maybe that was just the natural family solipsism at work.

In any case, my horse liked it not   He shivered any time he came near it, and had to be forced to  continue.  Perhaps he sensed what lay ahead for him.  I wish he had warned me.
